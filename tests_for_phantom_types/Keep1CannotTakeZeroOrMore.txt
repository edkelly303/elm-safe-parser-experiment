-- TYPE MISMATCH --------------------------------- Keep1CannotTakeZeroOrMore.elm

The 1st argument to `keep1` is not what I expect:

7|     SP.keep1 (SP.succeed ())
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This `succeed` call produces:

    SP.Parser SP.ZeroOrMore ()

But `keep1` needs the 1st argument to be:

    SP.Parser SP.OneOrMore ()
