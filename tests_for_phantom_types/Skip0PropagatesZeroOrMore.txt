-- TYPE MISMATCH --------------------------------- Skip0PropagatesZeroOrMore.elm

Something is off with the body of the `x` definition:

8|>    SP.succeed (always ())
9|>        |> SP.skip0 (SP.succeed ())

The body is:

    SP.Parser SP.ZeroOrMore (b -> ())

But the type annotation on `x` says it should be:

    SP.Parser SP.OneOrMore ()
